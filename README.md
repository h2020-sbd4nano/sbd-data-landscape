# Sbd4Nano Dataset / Database Landscape

THIS REPO IS PRIVATE AND UNTIL WE HAVE PERMISSION MUST NOT BE SHARED.

This repository relates to SbD4Nano Task 2.1.1 "Library of comprehensive data on ENMs properties and bioactivities".

## Plan

* create turtle files with metadata info of datasets and databases
  * model *everything* for now as `void:Dataset`
* keep manually added data in a separate file
* we'll extract automatically data and models from:
   * Data sets
      * FAIRSharing
      * Wikidata
      * NanoWiki (Studies, RelationShips)
   * Models
      * JRC
      * QSARDB
      * NanoSolveIT / NanoInformaTIX
      
NB. Information about Diamonds models with an unknown license can be found [in this repository](https://github.com/h2020-sbd4nano/sbd-data-diamonds/)

## Analysis

We will use SPARQL to summarize and visualize the collected data.
