# Sbd4Nano Dataset / Database Landscape

THIS REPO IS PRIVATE AND UNTIL WE HAVE PERMISSION MUST NOT BE SHARED.

## Plan

* create turtle files with metadata info of datasets and databases
  * model *everything* for now as `void:Dataset`
* keep manually added data in a separate file
* we'll extract automatically data and models from:
   * Data sets
      * FAIRSharing
      * Wikidata
      * NanoWiki (Studies, RelationShips)
   * Models
      * JRC
      * QSARDB
      * NanoSolveIT / NanoInformaTIX

## Analysis

We will use SPARQL to summarize and visualize the collected data.
